# PL_4inarow_scala_project
Connect Four is a two-player connection board game, in which the players take turns dropping tokens or crosses into a vertically suspended grid. Whichever player manages to connect 4 tokens of the same shape horizontally, vertically or diagonally wins the game.

The project was done as part of the IT 305 Programming Languages course at International Burch University, and implemented in the Scala programming language.
